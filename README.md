#MovieApp

This python application is run in the command line. Enter your movie choice
and it will pull data from IMDB API and gives you the option of what data
about the movie you would like to view. Can read through comments one by one,
with the option to stop anytime. Will be updated relatively frequently with new
features! I'm just trying to learn some more python and my coding experience.
